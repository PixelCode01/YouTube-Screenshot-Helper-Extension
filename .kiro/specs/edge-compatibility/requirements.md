# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for making the YouTube Screenshot Helper extension fully compatible with Microsoft Edge. The extension was originally developed for Chrome, and while there is an Edge version available, it contains errors that need to be fixed. The goal is to ensure the extension works seamlessly in Edge while maintaining all functionality available in the Chrome version.

1. WHEN the extension's popup is opened in Edge THEN it SHALL display correctly without visual glitches
2. WHEN the extension's options page is opened in Edge THEN it SHALL display all settings correctly
3. WHEN the extension shows notifications in Edge THEN they SHALL appear correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the extension to correctly inject content scripts into video sites when using Edge, so that I can capture screenshots from all supported sites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting YouTube in Edge THEN the extension SHALL correctly inject its content scripts
2. WHEN visiting Vimeo in Edge THEN the extension SHALL correctly inject its content scripts
3. WHEN visiting Twitch in Edge THEN the extension SHALL correctly inject its content scripts
4. WHEN visiting custom sites configured in settings THEN the extension SHALL correctly inject its content scripts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the extension's manifest is correctly configured for Edge, so that it declares all necessary permissions and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension's manifest is loaded by Edge THEN it SHALL include all necessary permissions
2. WHEN the extension's manifest includes Edge-specific settings THEN they SHALL be correctly formatted
3. IF Edge requires different manifest entries than Chrome THEN the Edge manifest SHALL include those differences
